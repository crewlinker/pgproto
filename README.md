# pgproto

## Features
- Uses pg_query for full query support (uses postgres source code)
- Well-tested, name coverage and having run the parsing on complex queries from some complex open-source projects.

## Usage
- Explain what "well-typed" means, and what the standard is
- COULD explain what types are supported explictly, and how to use "CREATE CAST" to work around this
- Explain how creating custom casts help move the complexity to postgres
- Have some sort of playground to show how the parsing works
